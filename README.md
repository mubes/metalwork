An Orbuculum is a Crystal Ball, used for seeing things that would be otherwise invisible. In this case, it's the analysis of instrumentation messaging from ARM CORTEX CPUs.

You can find information about using this suite at [Orbcode](https://www.orbcode.org), especially the 'Data Feed' section.

This repository is what will, I hope, eventually become Orbuculum V3.0.0...a Rust re-implementation of Orbuculum. At the moment it is hopelessly incomplete. I am using the re-implementation exercise to learn Rust by executing a reasonably sizable project, while not needing to do too much design work :-)  Fringe benefits of doing this include getting the implementation closer to the specification documentation, updating for ARM-v8m, and *test cases*.

You are highly advised to use the C version of Orbuculum, V2.2.x, from [The Orbuculum repository](https://github.org/orbcode/orbuculum). At the moment this code is really only
for the kinds of people who like watching others in pain.
